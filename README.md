The .exe file contains the download file.
When you go to install, Windows antivirus may pop-up, if so click "more options" then "run anyway". This will then take you to the install wizard
Feel free to make a desktop shortcut with the install wizard aswell.
Everything seems to be working as intended, except a few bugs that I won't be fixing.
